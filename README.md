##Creating gifs collection by using GIPHY API

This app takes the holiday name from holiday array and create buttons in HTML page.
* A loop used to append a button for each string in the array.
   
When the user clicks on a button, the page grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Under every gif, its title and rating displayed.
   
The input form takes a value from a user input box and adds it to holiday array.
 _When the submit button clicks, it creates button iff text is added to the input box._
