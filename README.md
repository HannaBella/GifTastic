## Holiday Giphy collection 

Giftastic app has some holiday buttons to start with and user can also add their choice of holiday. When the user add a holiday name, the app adds it to holiday array and it creates button with the given input name.

- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, it triggers an on-click function that animates the gif. 
- If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing. Under every gif, its title and parental rating displayed.
